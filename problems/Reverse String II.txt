Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "bacd"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
1 <= k <= 104


Questions:


Conditions:
- For every 2k chars in s
	- Reverse first k chars
- If len(s) < k, reverse s
- If  k <= len(s) < 2k, reverse first k char 

Approach:

- Since string are immutable, we convert it to list
- Traverse this list in jumps of 2*k, reversing the first k chars


Code:


def reverseStr(s, k):
	n = len(s)
	s = list[s]
	
	for i in range(0, n, 2*k):
		#reverse first k chars
		l, r = i, k - 1
		
		while l < r:
			temp = s[r]
			s[r] = s[l]
			s[l] = temp
			
			l += 1
			r -= 1
	return s
