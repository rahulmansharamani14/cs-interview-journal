#You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.
#
#An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.
#
#Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.
#
#The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.
#
# 
#
#Example 1:
#
#
#Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
#Output: 2
#Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
#There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
#1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
#2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
#Example 2:
#
#
#Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
#Output: 1
# 
#
#Constraints:
#
#m == obstacleGrid.length
#n == obstacleGrid[i].length
#1 <= m, n <= 100
#obstacleGrid[i][j] is 0 or 1.
